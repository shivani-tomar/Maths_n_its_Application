# Complex Numbers And its History :-

## Complex Numbers :-

Complex numbers is a combination of real and imagimary number. 

for example -  a + bi

where a = real number like 1,2,3,4
      b is imaginary number as 1i , 2i , 3i etc where i   = imaginary number.

## From where complex number arises :- 

complex number came into existence due to following equation 

X^3 + X^2 + X^1 + 1

When we try to find out its roots then we got -1 and and equation x^2 + 1

While solving equation : - 

X^2 + 1 =  0

X^2 =  -1

X = squareroot(-1)

(which is impossible in maths as square cannot be negative.)

From the line (3) imaginary number started and can be wriiten as following 

X = i or 1i

Thhis is all from where complex number started.
