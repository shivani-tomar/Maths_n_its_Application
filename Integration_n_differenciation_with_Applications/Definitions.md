# Differenciation :- 

Differenciation means to break a large object into smallest piece to do some calculation on it as the object is so much large to analyse and to do some calculation or finding its properties. Assuming that whole object will hold same properties as its small piece have. It help scientists and engineerings to predict or calculate the result.


# Integration :-

Integration means to combine the small same type of pieces of an object to do some calculation or to do some analysis on it to know about it as the object is too small to visible. In such cases we use integration. For example , circle is a set of points on the plane where each point is unique. So, if we want to analize the point then we need to integrate to form a circle as a point is too small.
