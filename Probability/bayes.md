# Naive Bayes Theorum : - 

If E1, E2 , ...., En are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events such that P(Ei) > 0 for each i and A is an arbitrary event 
for which P(A) is not equal to 0 , then conditional probability of occurnce of Ei, given that A has already occured will be 

        P(Ei/A) =                           P(Ei) * P(A/Ei)
