# Difference between conditional probability and bayes theorum : -

Most of the people are confused in naive bayes theorum and conditional probability and suppose that these two terms are same
and can be used interchangebaly. But guys... this is not true. There is a difference between bayes theorum and 
condtional probability. Let me explain it.

Bayes theorum is enchanced version of conditional probability when sample space is divided into multiple regions. While conditional probability only tells of probability of happening and event while B is already occured.

Conditional probability is generized version while Bayes theorum is specialized version.
