# Probability  : - 

probability is made up of two words probe (means observation) + ability i.e.e ability to observe the outcomes.

In maths , it may be defined as the ration of desired outcomes to the total outcomes.

For ex. if we toss a coin , what is the probability that the head will appear.

So, desired output is {H}
total output is {H,T}

so probability is 1/2 = 0.5
