# RANDOM VARIABLE : - 

it is like other variables holding some value for and event.

For example :- IF I toss a coin three times then what is the probability  that head occurs 0 times , 1 one , 2 time and 3 time

total outcomes = {HHH, HHT , HTH,THH,TTT,TTH,THT,HTT}

Head occurs : - 

 0 times = {TTT} 1/8
 1 time = {TTH,THT,HTT} 3/8
 2 time = {HHT,HTH,THH} 3/8
 3 time = {HHH} 1/8

 Hese in above example, we can also say occurence of head as random variable  X which values are 0,1,2,3 representing x1,x2,x3,x4

 ## TYPES OF RANDOM VARIABLE :- 

 ### Discrete random variable : - 

 Random variable which are countable like no. of heads in above example is called discrete random variable.


 ### Continuous random variable : - 

 random variable whose value are non countable or given in interval is called continuous random variable.

 ex :- 
 height of students ina a school is between 140cms to 170 cms. SO, its a interval [140,160]. where value can lies anywhere like 153.33 etc are called continuous random variable.
