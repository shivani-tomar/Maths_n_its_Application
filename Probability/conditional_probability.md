# CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY : - 

Let A and B be two eventsassociated with some random experiment. Then probability of occurence and A while B has already occured is called condtional probability od A by B representing as follow : - 

P(A/B) = P(A^B)/P(B)

where ^ = intersection.

for example : - 

In, a school there are 1000 students aout of which 430 are girls students. 10% of them are in 12th class.A student is chosen randomly, what is the probability the the chosen student id from 12th class given that student is girl ?
