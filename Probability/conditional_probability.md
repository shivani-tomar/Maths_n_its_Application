# CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY : - 

Let A and B be two events associated with some random experiment. Then probability of occurence and A while B has already occured is called condtional probability of A by B i.e. probability of A while B has already occured which can be representing as follow : - 

P(A/B) = P(A^B)/P(B)

where ^ = intersection.

for example : - 

If I roll a die then what will be the probability of getting a even number while the number is less than 4.

Now, in the above question , 

total no. of events are  =  {1,2,3,4,5,6}  (6 in no.)
let event A is getting a number less than 4 which are  = {1,2,3}  (3 in no.)
let event B is getting a number which is even which are  = {2,4,6}  (3 in no.)


Now probability of getting an even number from the numbers which are less than 4 are = {2}  (1 in no.)

Thus P(A/B) = 1/3 
as {2} is the only even number among {1,2,3}

## From the formula :- 

A = {1,2,3}
B = {2,4,6}
A^B = {2}
total events = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
then 
P(A/B) = P(A^B)/P(B)

P(A^B) = 1/6
p(B) = 1/2

P(A/B) = (1/6)/(1/2)
       = 1/3
       
 which is same as above.
